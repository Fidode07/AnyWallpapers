# 🖼️ AnyWallpapers 🖼️
I know what you're wondering now. "AnyWallpapers, that sounds like a bad crawler". But don't worry: it's cool. Maybe "Wallpaper Engine" means something to you? I "reprogrammed" it in Python. Well I made other features, but hey: It's free and especially for Python it's a good perfomance. Feel free to read the README, then you will learn more and be amazed.

# 👨‍💻 Requirements 👨‍💻
I could now annoy everyone and say it is only the requirements.txt. But for once I do not xD. Here you have a List with URL's:
1. <strong>.NET6</strong> (<a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0">Download Page</a>)
2. <strong>Python</strong> (Testet on 3.8, <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-388rc1/">Download</a>)
3. <strong>WebView2 Runtime</strong> - Just download the Installer (<a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/de-de/microsoft-edge/webview2/">Download</a>)
4. <strong>Windows 10</strong> - No idea if it works on other Windows versions (Linux currently not supported)

# 📝 Usage 📝
1. <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0">Download .NET6</a> (The Python requirements can only be installed after that)
2. <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-388rc1/">Download Python</a> <strong>if not installed</strong>
3. Install Requirements Download the requirements with the following commands:
```
  cd location/of/project
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/de-de/microsoft-edge/webview2/">Download WebView2 Runtime</a> (Installer)
5. Enjoy the Engine by start "AnyWallpapers.exe" or with:
```
  cd location/of/project
  python Engine.py
```
  <br><br>
<strong>Possible Errors:</strong>
1. It is possible that an error occurs at step 3. This is often due to Python and pythonnet. In this case you can simply do:
```
  pip install --pre pythonnet
```
and then repeat step 3.

After starting the Engine.py 1 time or the first time start the .exe, a shortcut to the .exe file should appear on the desktop. This means that the command does not have to be executed 1 more time afterwards.

# 🔥 Features 🔥
1. Tray Icon
2. Multiple Screen Support
3. Video(s) are paused when another window is maximized or fullscreen
4. After 1 video is paused it will be synchronized with the others again
5. YouTube videos are also possible as background video
6. Powerful "editor" (It is rather an editor tab) to edit the video into a new dimension

# ❓ How to use? ❓
There are things that are not so obvious. Here I will explain a few things
