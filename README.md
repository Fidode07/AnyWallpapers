# AnyWallpapers
I know what you're wondering now. "AnyWallpapers, that sounds like a bad crawler". But don't worry: it's cool. Maybe "Wallpaper Engine" means something to you? I "reprogrammed" it in Python. Well I made other features, but hey: It's free and especially for Python it's a good perfomance. Feel free to read the README, then you will learn more and be amazed.
